## ♡ Hello

I'm an artist, game developer, and university graduate design student.

I love drawing, old video games, anime/manga, and other nerd things.

My works are primarily made with Clip Studio Paint EX, Aseprite, and GameMaker. I've been developing since 2014 and began learning to draw since 2024.
