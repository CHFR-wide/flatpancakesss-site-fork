A collection of my smaller game development projects, consisting almost entirely of game jam submissions and short Touhou fangames that I developed on my spare time during my school years. 

I have a larger, original game currently in development, but it will take a lot of time. For now, enjoy these smaller titles. Each game runs in your browser with no downloads necessary.

This is referring specifically to **game development** works. For artworks, see either [Twitter](https://x.com/flatpancakesss) or [Pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/53132406).

# untilted Daiyousei fangame
#### Unreleased. Developed October 2023

A prototype for a bullet hell adventure game. While barely even a playable game, it's still an important landmark for me as the gameplay concept for eventually evolved into my university final project, and the narrative concept evolved into a much larger project that is still currently in the works.

# Hyperspace
#### Unreleased. Developed March 2022.

Something I made in 2 days for a school exam when I was like 16. I had no ability to draw at this time, but I used that to my advantage. Creating simple geometric shapes, with a mostly monochrome artstyle.

#### Released April 2021.

The original Reimu's Donation Box is a Touhou Flash game from 2007. Once Flash Player was shut down in December 2020, I wanted to recreate the game. I didn't have a computer at this time, so I made this using Scratch.
