A collection of my smaller game development projects, consisting almost entirely of game jam submissions and short Touhou fangames that I developed on my spare time during my school years. 

I have a larger, original game currently in development, but it will take a lot of time. For now, enjoy these smaller titles. Each game runs in your browser with no downloads necessary.

This is referring specifically to **game development** works. For artworks, see either [Twitter](https://x.com/flatpancakesss) or [Pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/53132406).
