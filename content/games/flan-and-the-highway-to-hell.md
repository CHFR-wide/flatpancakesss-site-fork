A 2.5D Touhou racing fangame in a similar style to what was seen in 80s arcades. 

[Touhou Fan Game Jam 13](https://itch.io/jam/touhou-fan-game-jam-13) submission, co-developed with [Jwap](https://x.com/jwapptastic), [Ougi](https://x.com/Ougiikun), and [Redi](https://x.com/redi_rkgk). Our first game working together as a group, jokingly called the 'Flandre Appreciation Club'.
