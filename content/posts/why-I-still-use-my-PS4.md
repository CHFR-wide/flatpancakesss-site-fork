Ever since I got my PS5 in 2021, I've found myself constantly going back to my old PS4 instead. Each time I revisit the console, I've been feeling that I prefer using my old PS4 to the newer PS5, but so far I've been unable to pinpoint exactly why. 

Instead of stressing about how to properly articulate my thoughts in a structured way, I've compiled some poorly organised ramblings about my opinions on the two consoles, and why I still use my PS4 instead of my PS5.

## User Experience

At first I wasn't that interested in getting a PS5. I'm not some "ultra hardcore pro gamer" who's going out of their way to buy and play the newest games as soon as possible. For the majority of the PS4's generation, I played almost nothing but Minecraft, Overwatch, and Terraria, and I was fine with that.  The only reason I bought a PS5 was when it was announced that all PS4 games are playable on PS5. I felt that "oh if I can play all of my current games while also having access to all the new games in the future, then I might as well upgrade to the PS5". 

For that purpose, the PS5 works perfectly fine. It can play all of my games without issue, both older ones and PS5-only ones. As for these newer PS5-only games, I've only played Helldivers 2 and Astro's Playroom but they wworked fine, I have no complaints there.

My real issues with the PS5 come from the User Experience. Even when all of my games are playable on PS5, some even being enhanced, the UX is what keeps me constantly going back to my PS4.

I have never been a fan of the PS5's UI design. I even distinctly remember watching the UI reveal showcase and thinking to myself "this isn't finalised... right?". The UI is split into 2 sections, the Control Center and the Home Screen. I'll start with talking about the Control Center first.

## Control Center

The Control Center is essentially a rework of the PS4's Quick Menu, but this time the entire UI is designed around [this new 'Cards' gimmick](https://youtu.be/7TBPrYJDoDE?t=132). I don't like these cards for the same reason I don't like Windows 11's default centred taskbar. Different types of Cards can come and go depending on a bunch of different situations. If you're in a voice chat with someone, have a news update from a game that you follow, etc, a new card for that appears on the Control Center. This means the UI layout of the buttons is constantly moving around and shifting places, preventing you from developing any sort of muscle memory.

Cards can also include something called Activity Cards. They were advertised as a way to quickly jump to any part of the game straight from the Control Center or Home Screen rather than loading it normally. But most games don't use these Activity Cards at all, and the ones that do don't implement them well at all. The times I've actually *tried* to use an Activity Card, it didn't even work properly and I was kicked back to the title screen anyways.

Cards also seem to get very confused within multiplayer games. Sonic Racing Crossworlds 

Even some older games got screwed up, with Garden Warfare showinng me completely random public lobbies.

Not only are Cards on PS5 very clunky and kinda useless, Sony can also push ads to your Control Center through them. Here's an ad for Concord that I couldn't get rid of. 

Compare this to the PS4's Quick Menu. It does everything that you could possibly need to access at a quick moment. I had mine set up in a way that I can quickly access my Notifications, my Friend's List (for sending invites) It's clean, fast, and the buttons are always where I want them to be. There's no unnecessary clutter or ads

## Home Screen

As for the Home Screen, I'm not a fan of the design either. Part of me feels like it's just poorly designed by accident, but another part of me feels that it's specifically designed in a way to boost PS Store sales. I'm going to sound like a crazed conspiracy theorist here, but just try to stay with me

Games appear far too small on the dashboard for my liking, making them feel kind of insignificant in a way.  I wonder if this was on purpose? Seeing as the button to buy an in-game add-on is 2x larger than the button to actually open the game, it feels like its designed in a way where the add-on is supposed to be more attention grabbing than anything else on the screen.

The PlayStation Store was also incorperated directly into the UI, rather than being a seperate app. This sounded cool to me at first (especially with how slow the store is on PS4) until I realised it's just a way for Sony to put these ads for microtransactions directly onto the dashboard for your games, and also let you impuslively buy them without having to manually navigate to the PS Store app and wait for it to load.

Themes and custom backgrounds are sadly gone too. I saw a lot of people defending this by saying that "custom backgrounds can't work on PS5", as the background is set to the cover art of the game you're currently looking at. But the PSP and PS3 both had game-specific backgrounds and would allowed custom backgrounds at the same time, so I find that point to be irrelevant.

Imagine if everybody had to use the default wallpaper on their phone, or their PC, etc. Wouldn't that just be boring? Don't you want to personalise your phone, even just a iittle bit?

If I wanted to be cynical, I could say it's to allow developers to put full screen ads on the dashboards for their games. I mean there's already cases of [that being done already](https://youtu.be/gQ9wgBHuEP0?t=274).

Cards and Activities are also incoperated into the home screen, and once again they're very poorly implemented. Zenless Zone Zero would tell me to join the multiplayer lobbies of my friends (the game didn't have multiplayer yet) and Modern Warfare II was permanently stuck on telling me to play the first mission of the campaign even after I had finished it, Some older games would strangely display public matchmaking servers, even though were full so I wouldn't be able to join even if I wanted.

Activities can also change the background image and more often than not it's just an in game screenshot. There was even one time where Overwatch 2 managed to push a temporary placeholder asset out as the game's background.

Yes, these issues are the fault of the games and not Sony, but it still negatively impacts the user experience.

An issue I have with both the UI as a whole is how extremely *DARK* everything is. There's no colour to anything, everything is either black or grey and there's also a darkness vingette filter applied to everything too. It just feels dark and depressing. Even when I applied a bright pink wallpaper to my Welcome Hub, 

## Game Library

'Installed' makes sense, but its under 'Your Collection' where the problems start.

All physical games appear in this menu too... why? They're physical games, you can't download them from the Library as you need the insert the disc. Again, it feels cluttered



## Welcome Hub

In the USA, there used to be a tab called "Explore" which was basically just ads

In late 2024, Sony replaced Expore with the Welcome Hub to the PS5 dashboard. The Welcome Hub is easily my favourite PS5 feature. It feels like too little too late.

## Games

Even with all of my issues aside, do the games save the PS5? 

I'm sure you've heard the joke

When I'm not really interested in new games, I would just rather stick to my PS4 where I can play the same things but with a more pleasant user experience.

Helldivers 2, Astro's Playroom
