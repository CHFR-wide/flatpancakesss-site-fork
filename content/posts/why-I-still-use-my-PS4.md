Ever since I got my PS5 in 2021, I've found myself constantly going back to my old PS4 instead. Each time I revisit the console, I've been feeling that I prefer using my old PS4 to the newer PS5, but so far I've been unable to pinpoint exactly why. 

Instead of stressing about how to properly articulate my thoughts in a structured way, I've compiled some poorly organised ramblings about my opinions on the two consoles, and why I still use my PS4 instead of my PS5.

## Games

Ever heard the "[PS5 has no games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3gDw8tWLyk)" joke? Well it''s not really a joke. My main issue with the console is that there's nothing on PS5 that I couldn't already play on PS4. I've had a PS5 since 2020/21 and every game that I was interested in also released alongside a PS4 version. 

With these PS5 games available on PS4, they genuinely look and feel the exact same to me. In a way, it feels like I could've skipped out on the PS5 entirely and not missed much by playing just the PS4 versions. I actually completed 100% of Spider-Man Miles Morales on both the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 and I was completely unable to tell the difference between them other than fast travel loading times. Playing the PS4 version doesn't feel 'inferior' and the PS5 version doesn't feel 'superior', they just felt entirely identical.

##### Can you tell if this is PS4 or PS5?

I've even noticed that some of the games I am into started skipping the PS5 entirely. Touhou Danmaku Kagura released in 2024 for PS4, yet has no PS5 version. Void Terrarium is available for both PS4 and PS5, but Void Terrarium 2 is PS4 only. I theorise that some indie developers are perhaps finding the PS5 to be entirely unnecessary, opting to make only a PS4 version of their game as you can still play it natively on PS5 anyways.

## Media playback

Media playback on PS5 is much more focused around digital streaming services than prior PlayStations were. If you are someone who is subscribed to and actively uses these services, the way that they are intergrated into the PS5 is probably perfect for you.

I was subscribed to a Crunchyroll free trial back when the PS5 was new and swapping between playing a game or watching a show was practically seamless. I had even uploaded a video praising the feature.

##### Don't mind the terrible gameplay, I was just showcasing the feature... ^ ^;

I have to admit that this is a huge upgrade over the PlayStation 3 and 4. Media apps on those consoles (PS3 especially) are extremely slow and clunky to use. 

However, I do not pay for any of these services. Everything that I watch or play I buy their physical releases and download them to storage drives. For someone like me, these streaming features are not used at all outside of very rare occasions.

Thankfully, the PS5 still provides more traditional, offline alternatives. There is a built in Media Player application for viewing pictures, videos, and audio from a USB drive, and the disc drive supports both DVDs and Blu-rays. CDs are not supported, though you can still put those files onto a USB drive and then listen to them through the Media Player so it doesn't really matter in my opinion. 

Unfortunately, the Media Player on PS5 is **extremely** slow. I'm not sure how this is even an issue considering that both the PS4 and even the PS3 had no trouble with this. 

So while the PS5 *can* do media playback through external drives, its generally a lot slower than it is on PS3 or 4.

## UI / Features / etc

Apologies in advance, but here is where I'm going to get extremely petty about things that I don't think most people care about.

I have never been a fan of the PS5's UI design. I even distinctly remember watching the UI reveal showcase and thinking to myself "this isn't finalised... right?". The UI is split into 2 sections, the Control Center and the Home Screen. I'll start with talking about the Control Center first.

The Control Center is essentially a rework of the PS4's Quick Menu, but this time entire UI is designed around [this new 'Cards' gimmick](https://youtu.be/7TBPrYJDoDE?t=132). I don't like these cards for the same reason I don't like Windows 11's default centred taskbar. Different types of Cards can come and go depending on a bunch of different situations. If you're in a voice chat with someone, have a news update from a game that you follow, etc, a new card for that appears on the Control Center which means the UI layout of the buttons is constantly moving around and shifting places, preventing you from developing any sort of muscle memory.

Cards can also include something called Activity Cards. They were advertised as a way to quickly jump to any part of the game straight from the Control Center or Home Screen rather than loading it normally. But most games don't use these Activity Cards at all, and the ones that do don't implement them well at all. The one time I actually *tried* to use an Activity Card, it didn't even work properly and I was kicked back to the title screen anyways.

As for the Home Screen, I'm not a fan of the design either. 

The PlayStation Store was also incorperated directly into the UI, rather than being a seperate app, which sounded cool at first until you realise it's just a way for Sony to put ads for DLCs, currencies and pre-orders directly on the dashboard for your games.

Themes and custom backgrounds are gone too. I saw a lot of people trying to defend this by saying that custom backgrounds can't work on PS5, as the background set to the cover art of the game you're currently looking at on the Home Screen. But the PSP and PS3 both had game-specific backgrounds and would also allow custom backgrounds at the same time, so I find that point to be irrelevant.

There was even one time where Overwatch 2 managed to push a temporary placeholder asset out as the game's background.

An issue I have with both the Control Center and Home Screen is how extremely *DARK* everything is. There's no colour to anything, everything is either black or grey and there's also a darkness filter applied to everything too. It just feels dark and depressing 

Imagine if you had to use the default wallpaper on your phone, or your PC.

In late 2024, Sony added the Welcome Hub to the PS5 dashboard. The Welcome Hub is easily my favourite PS5 feature. It feels like too little too late.

## Performance

Certain games run signifcantly better on PS5 than they do on PS4.

Sometimes a friend of mine wants to play Fortnite with me. In that case I will play the PS5 version as it's much more stable.

On more intensive games, the screenshot menu and trophies can lag really bad.

## Conclusion

While the PS5 is undeniably better for raw performance, that level of power is mostly unnecessary for the games that I am interested in playing. 

For the average person, I'm certain that the PS5 is a direct upgrade that replaces any need to own a PS4.

By staying on PS4, I still have all the games that I want and a better user experience. with a nicer interface, deeper customisation features, and more a reliable Media Player application. I am not bothered by the slightly slower loading times.

Media streaming apps are significantly improved on PS5 compared to prior PlayStations, but I am not subscribed to these services so it doesn't make a difference for me
