With 2025 ending soon, I wanted to take a look back on my personal highlight of the year. Back in June, I flew over to the USA to attend the TouhouFest convention in Los Angeles once again.

I've been a Touhou fan for the majority of my life. but it's difficult to find other fans where I live.

I've also attended TouhouFest before, the other 2 iterations back in 2023 and 2024.

I stayed in LA from Thursday to Sunday (12 June->15 June)

I'll break it down into each individual day to discuss my time in LA and TouhouFest.

## Thursday (The journey and arriving in Los Angeles) 

Out of everything, the journey to LA was the most exhausting part of the trip. Coming from Europe, the distance between where I live and the west coast of the USA is about 9000km (6000miles). I had to wake up around 3AM, be driven into the nearest city so that I could take a 4 hour bus ride from that city down to a *different* city in order to reach the airport. By the time I've reached the airport I've already been travelling for several hours and from there, the flight to LA was still another 11 hours or so.

While waiting to board the flight, I spotted someone else in the line who had Touhou keychains on their bag. After approaching them, I found that we were both going to TouhouFest. Seeing as we were headed to the same place, I offered that we could share a taxi to save us some money.

On the flight itself, there wasn't much to do of course. I did some drawing (which is really difficult when you're in a moving vehicle thats constantly shaking ^ ^;), rewatched Sonic the Hedgehog 3, and then probably fell asleep for the remainder of the flight.

After getting off the plane, I met up again with Rendroken at the entrance to the airport. We took the bus down to the taxi depot, and then went to our hotel. 

My friend VictorTB27 was staying in the hotel nextdoor to mine, so I went over to go meet with him after I'd gotten unpacked. We had already planned our meeting in advance as we wanted to hang out prior to the convention weekend. He also had some keychains to give to me. 

Victor had brought his Nintendo Switch with him and set it up on the hotel TV. We fucked around together on Danmaku Kagura for a bit.

After playing around in his hotel room for a few hours, I headed out on my own to the nearby mall for some food. I hadn't actually eaten yet since arriving in LA, so I was straving. There is resturant in the food court that sells some chicken I love.

After I had eaten, I met back up with Victor and a few of his friends to go do some shopping in the mall. I'm not too sure what the "average" mall is like in the USA, but this one in particular is pretty good for anime-adjacent things. There's several large stores for figures, manga, games, miscellaneous merch, etc, which made it a good spot for us to shop around.

I was starting to feel pretty exahausted after a long day of travelling and shopping, so I left the group early around 7PM to head back to my room and rest. I had also decided not to buy anything at the mall just yet. During my stay in 2024, I bought an expensive Marisa Kirisame figure on the Friday before TouhouFest which left me without much money to spend at the convention itself.

## Friday (TouhouFest Day 0)

While the convention doesn't officialy start until the weekend, you could claim your badge the day before to skip waiting in line on the weekend. Registration didn't start until 3PM however, so I had some time to wait.

went to Beverly Hills with my mother.

I still had some time to kill before heading down to the convention center, so I went back to the mall for some more shopping. I found a whole bunch of Touhou manga though they were un-translated. My Japanese reading isn't very good but I still wanted to buy something, so I bought Who's Who.

As soon as I had gotten back to my hotel room, I passed out immediately.

## Saturday (TouhouFest Day 1)

Unlike Touhoufest 2023 and 24, which were hosted in Spring, this years' was hosted during the summer. I managed to get sunburnt at THF2024 even though it was only April

we both ended up spending lots of money almost instnatly

Later in the afternoon, I met back up with Wyn to . Rivals of Aether with modded Touhou characters. I've never played the main game of Rivals of Aether but I had played with the Touhou mods back in 2021.

By this point, I had already bought 100s of dollars worth of stuff, so I headed back to my room for a short rest and to free up some space in my bag.

After the first artist performance, I told my friends good night and that I was heading back to my hotel.

Miko was there for a surprise performance

I immediately rushed my way back down to the convention center, but she
