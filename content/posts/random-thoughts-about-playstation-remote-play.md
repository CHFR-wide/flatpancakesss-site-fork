+++

Remote Play feels like one of those lesser known PlayStation features. I rarely see anybody talk about it, let alone actually even using it. It's a pretty niche feature that doesn't have many uses, but it's something I've played around with a few times over the years and I wanted to write about some random thoughts and memories I have with using it.

In case you don't know, Remote Play is a form of online game streaming. It lets you control PlayStation console from another device, typically another PlayStation or a phone. It's a very similar concept to cloud gaming, .

I was first introduced to Remote Play through an ad I saw on the TV.

Being a young child with no TV of my own, I had to share the family TV. Whenever my family wanted to use the TV, it left me unable to use my shiny new PS4. very similar to how the Wii U was advertised actually.

##### not the same ad, but all I could find online

Even though I was onboard with the idea, I didn't really ever use Remote Play for many years

## Remote Play on PS Vita

At the time, there was a lot of discussion about Persona 5 and Nintendo Switch. I used Remote Play on my PS Vita 

I also tried some BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle.

## Remote Play on mobile

I've talked about this before in my drawings, but I used to be

In 2023, I used to farm on Fortnite Save the World while I was at school. I built a huge AFK farm that I could leave running for hours while farming resources, such as player XP and achievement progress.

The farm wasn't fully 100% automatic though, as it still needed to be manually restarted once every 2 or 3 hours. I'd start the farm before leaving for school, 

For some reason, even though Fortnite has a mobile version, STW has never been available on mobile. My solution was to try out the Remote Play mobile app. After starting the farm then leaving for school, I'd set a 3 hour timer on my phone. Once the timer expired, I'd connect to my PS5 using Remote Play on my phone and restart the farm to get it up and running again.

However, in this case the connection was TERRIBLE. The video feed was a barely visible, pixelated mess, the audio sounded like it was underwater and there was an extreme input delay. I didn't think much of it though, after all I was using school wifi so I assumed it was just shitty network conditions.

## Remote Play on PS4

When the PlayStation 5 came out, the PS4 was updated with a new PS5 Remote Play app. This seemed entirely pointless to me. "Why would I use my PS4 to control my PS5? Why don't I just use my PS5?"

Maybe this could be useful for someone with 2 houses? Such as a child who lives with one parent during the week, but goes to the other for the weekend. But even then, it's still unnecessary as the PS4 can play most PS5 games. At worst you'll just have to wait a weekend until you have your PS5 back.

either way, I considered this app to be pointless and never ended up using it.

A few nights ago, I tested the PS4 link to PS5. The video feed was fine enough, but the input latency was a lot worse than my memories of 

I still had memories of Remote Play working completely fine back on PS Vita, so I went to test it out again

I did a small research project to try and find what the cause was.

## Cross-Controller

I was first introduced to Remote Play through the [LittleBigPlanet 2 Cross-Controller DLC Pack](https://littlebigplanet.fandom.com/wiki/LittleBigPlanet_2:_Cross-Controller_Pack) in late 2012. This DLC included new gameplay gimmicks in where you connect a PS Vita to your PS3 . 

## Why does Remote Play run better on PS Vita?

After some testing...

I'm not sure about the exact inner workings of Remote Play, but I can theorise. 

I believe that, on PS Vita, Remote Play works via some sort of local data transfer, similar to the Wii U GamePad. No internet is actually being used.

![alt text](images/RPnointernet.jpg)

the advertisement that I had shown earlier says "Remote Play dependant on Wifi signal strength"

if it takes too long to find your console locally, it switches to searching online

As for the modern iterations of Remote Play, I think they're entirely internet based. 

I have an internet speed of ~40Mbps download, and ~8Mbps upload. I've tested streaming both my PS5 to my PC, PS4, phone, and Vita with the same results each time.

This is how the PlayStation Portal should work too, but the device is just a cheap android tablet that runs the mobile Remote Play app, so I seriously cannot imagine that it works any better.

## An extra note about Cloud Streaming

Cloud Streaming and Remote Play are similar, but not the same thing. 

At first, the concept is actually quite intriguing.

In early 2017, I had taken a free trial of PS Now, a now [non-existant service](https://blog.playstation.com/2022/03/29/all-new-playstation-plus-launches-in-june-with-700-games-and-more-value-than-ever/#sf255029422). 

My PS3 had broken in 2014 and I would not get a new one until later in 2018, so 

I played through all of Sonic Generations, and the first few stages of Sonic Unleashed. I hadn't played Unleashed enough to earn any trophies but in Generations I had.

PlayStation Now is now a ... service. It was merged with PlayStation Plus in 2022.
