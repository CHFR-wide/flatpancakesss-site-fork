write some stuff about my background with MKDS

## header

In March of this year, a good friend of mine got interested in 3DS modding.  again earlier this year. For many nights, we would sit together on calls.

Eventually we came to online play, through Pretendo service. 

Outside of Pokemon Generation 6, I did not use the online services on 3DS so I had no affinity for any of the games.

however it reminded me of my favourite and most played DS game, Mario Kart DS.

As mentioned before, I had played this game extensively but never once had the chance to play it online. I suggested to Roy that I would really love to try and set this game up.

while the 3DS supports playing DS games, these are completely different consoles

Pretendo is only a service for 3DS. as the Nintendo DS/Wii ran off of WFC.

With some research, we quickly found that Wiimmfi has compatability for DS games too. 

so the plan was simple. Connect MKDS to Wiimmfi

## internet issues

The major issue is that the DS cannot connect to modern internet connections. Being an older console from 2004, it only supports WEP encryption which is outdated. Modern routers only supply [x] encrpytion which the DS is unable to connect to.

The first objective was to find a way to host a WEP encrypted connection with modern computers.

I read a post that said saying Android devices can host a mobile hotspot and change the encryption to WEP. This was great news for our group as we all use Android phones.

This worked fine for my friends, but for me it was not working.

I could connect to the online service, but I couldn't search for players without getting immediately disconnected.

I found that there was an app that I could use to host a hotspot from my computer. but it was Linux only.

this should have been an issue as I use a Windows 10 computer, but by complete coincidence, I had set up a Linux dualboot on my computer back at the end of 2021. I'd never even used it, and I can't recall why I installed it either.

Disconnects were a frequent problem. 

## How does the online multiplayer hold up?

Before talking about the actual gameplay, I'd like to talk about the specifics of online play as it is not the same as playing the game normally.

is that there are some compromises made.

While all characters and karts are available, only 20 of the 32 courses can be selected. Unfortunately this leaves some fan favourite courses such as Waluigi Pinball, Tick-Tock Clock or Airship Fortress completely out of the question. It is theorised that these courses are excluded because of potential hardware/network issues. These courses are more complex with more processing power required.

Online play is also missing some gamemodes and rulesets. Local multiplayer but online

Online has a fixed ruleset of in 2-4 player free-for-all, no CPU, in a set of 4 rounds. Balloon Battle and Shine Runners are unavailable. Before each round, players can vote on the next course just like what is seen in the later games.

The game was laggy, but we were also playing cross-regions from Europe to North America

The biggest issue by far, were the frequent number of disconnects. I would like to give some benefit of the doubt as...

## The gameplay

It would be impossible to write about Mario Kart DS multiplayer without discussing the game's most infamous technique: 'Snaking'

##### Snaking

By tapping left and right while drifting, you can build up a boost. This mechanic is easily exploitable and with good control you can chain drifts together constantly for free boosts. The name comes from the zigzag, "snake"-like pattern your kart makes as you drive along the course.

Snaking is what defines Mario Kart DS's multiplayer. The difference in speed between a player who is snaking and a player who is not is night and day. If you do not Snake, you do not stand a chance against players that are.

While I had never played online before this point, I had played local download play extensively and have been well aware of this

Snaking is controversial. Personally, I understand the complaints against it, but I find it to be a necesity to add complexity to the game. There are no air tricks or bikes that offer different drift types like in MKWii onwards, or no kart transformations like MK7 onwards.

Without Snaking, MKDS is a very basic Mario Kart game. Not boring no, but basic.

Online matches are also limited to only 4 players maximum, half of the intended player count.

I spent most of my time in 2 player 1v1s.
