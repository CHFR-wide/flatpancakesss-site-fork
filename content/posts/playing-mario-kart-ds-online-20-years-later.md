write some stuff about my background with MKDS

## header

got interested in 3DS modding again earlier this year

## internet issues

The major issue is that the DS cannot connect to modern internet connections. Being an older console from 2004, it only supports WEP encryption which is outdated. Modern routers only supply [x] encrpytion which the DS is unable to connect to.

The first objective was to find a way to host a WEP encrypted connection with modern computers.

I read a post that said saying Android devices can host a mobile hotspot and change the encryption to WEP. This was great news for our group as we all use Android phones.

This worked fine for my friends, but for me it was not working.

I could connect to the online service, but I couldn't search for players without getting immediately disconnected.

I found that there was an app that I could use to host a hotspot from my computer. but it was linux only

By complete coincidence, I had set up a Linux dualboot on my computer back at the end of 2021. I'd never even used it, and I can't recall why I installed it either.

Disconnects were a frequent problem.
