I've always been interested in the idea of creating my own personal website, but I never looked into it as I thought it would be too difficult and/or expensive.

Even though I had taught myself basic HTML when I was younger, I hadn't practiced it since 2016 so I'd forgotten most of it.

For years, I was using Twitter as somewhat of a substitute as without money or web development skills, I just assumed that hosting my own website was impossible.

But I've never been a fan of social media, so the idea of having my own personal website still remained on my mind.

**So how did I make this site?**

Earlier this year, I met CHFR and we became friends quickly through our shared interests.

CHFR has his own website, a personal blog just like this one. I found his website to be so adorable, it reminded me exactly of what I wanted to do back in 2016.

I eventually asked how his website was made, and he introduced me to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a pretty easy to use framework. He then provided me all of the documentation, gave me a detailed breakdown of how everything works, and held my hands through the setup process whenever I needed help.

After some work, this page you are reading now is the end result. Without his help, I would've had no idea how to set this up on my own, I owe a lot of thanks to him!

**What will this site be used for?**

I plan to use this site as a personal blog, mostly talking about (but not limited to):

- Drawing
- Old video games
- Game development
- Anything else I like, really

I've always loved writing about my passions and interests. If you are a friend of mine, then you're already well aware of my habit of message spamming fangirling about random things I care about. In a way, you can think of this website as an extension of that, but just in a different format that's easier to share and hopefully more permanent than Discord messages or Twitter posts are. 

This doesn't mean I'm going to stop using Twitter altogether, it's just not good for long form writing. I mean... I wasn't really posting anything on Twitter anyways lol, but here I have more freedom. I can write and format these posts however I want with no constraints on the amount of words or images I can use.

Writing this is pretty tricky! It's my first time writing in a such a longer format, so it feels very unusual and awkward, though I'd assume its because I'm not used to it and I will improve over time.

That's all I have to say for now, thank you for reading.

Special thanks to CHFR for helping me set this all up!
