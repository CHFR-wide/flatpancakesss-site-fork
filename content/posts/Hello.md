> hi chfr if you read this page this post isnt finished.. i mean you can read it now if you want to but its not really going to make any sense its totally unfinished

I've always been interested in the idea of creating my own personal website, but I never looked into it it as I thought it would be too difficult and expensive.

Even though I had taught myself basic HTML when I was younger, I haven't practiced it since 2016 and I'd forgotten most of it and I don't have much money to work with either.

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 

**something something section title wowie!**

Earlier this year, I met CHFR and we became friendly quickly through our shared interests.

CHFR has his own website, a personal blog just like this one.

His website really resonated with me as it felt exactly like what I had been looking for.

I eventually asked how his website was made, and he introduced me to HUGO. 

to which he provided me all of the documentation, gave me a detailed breakdown of how everything works. 

After some work, this page you are reading now is the end result.

Without his help, I would've had no idea how to set this up on my own, I owe a lot of thanks to him.

**What will this site be used for?**

I've always loved writing and sharing my ideas. I used to do this over on Twitter but I began to rapidly lose interest in the as the 2020s progressed. Having my own website also allows me more freedom. I can write and format these articles however I want with no constraints on the amount of words or images I can use.

I plan to use this site as a personal blog, mostly talking about (but not limited to):

- Drawing
- Old video games
- Game development
- Anything else I like, really

Writing this feels very unusual and awkward, though I'd assume its because I'm not used to it and I will improve over time.

Special thanks to CHFR for helping me set this all up!
