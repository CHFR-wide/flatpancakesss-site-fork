Remote Play feels like one of those lesser known PlayStation features. I rarely see anybody talk about it, let alone actually even using it. It's a pretty niche feature that doesn't have many uses, but it's something I've played around with a few times over the years and I wanted to write about some random thoughts and memories I have with using it.

In case you don't know, Remote Play is a form of online game streaming. It lets you control PlayStation console from another device, typically another PlayStation or a phone. It's a very similar concept to cloud gaming, .



Being a young child with no TV of my own, I had to share the family TV. Whenever my family wanted to use the TV, it left me unable to use my shiny new PS4. very similar to how the Wii U was advertised actually.

##### not the same ad, but all I could find online

I think the earliest case of when I tried to 

In 2018, I wanted to play Fortnite on my computer but didn't have the specs required for it. I found that you could use the PlayStation Remote Play app to stream your console to your PC. I decided to give it a try and it worked horribly.

Later on, in 2020, there was a lot of discussion about Persona 5 and Nintendo Switch. I used Remote Play on my PS Vita 

I also tried some BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle.

In 2022/23, I used remote play while at school to AFK farm FNSTW. The connection was unbearable, but I was using school wifi.



When the PlayStation 5 came out, the PS4 was updated with a new PS5 Remote Play app. This seemed entirely pointless to me. "Why would I use my PS4 to control my PS5? Why don't I just use my PS5?"

A few nights ago, I tested the PS4 link to PS5. The video feed was fine enough, but the input latency was a lot worse than my memories of 

## Cross-Controller

I was first introduced to Remote Play through the [LittleBigPlanet 2 Cross-Controller DLC Pack](https://littlebigplanet.fandom.com/wiki/LittleBigPlanet_2:_Cross-Controller_Pack) in late 2012. This DLC included new gameplay gimmicks in where you connect a PS Vita to your PS3 . 

## An extra note about Cloud Streaming

Cloud Streaming and Remote Play are similar, but not the same thing. 

At first, the concept is actually quite intriguing.

In early 2017, I had taken a free trial of PS Now, a now [non-existant service](https://blog.playstation.com/2022/03/29/all-new-playstation-plus-launches-in-june-with-700-games-and-more-value-than-ever/#sf255029422). 

My PS3 had broken in 2014 and I would not get a new one until later in 2018, so 

I played through all of Sonic Generations, and the first few stages of Sonic Unleashed. I hadn't played Unleashed enough to earn any trophies but in Generations I had.

PlayStation Now is now a ... service. It was merged with PlayStation Plus in 2022.
