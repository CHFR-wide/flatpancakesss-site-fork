I don't make videos that often, do I? The last video was over 7 months ago... ^ ^;

I changed my editing process quite a lot with this video, so I'd like to talk about it.

I use Davinchi Resolve 17 to edit. My computer isn't the strongest, so I've always had performance issues with the software. For smaller projects, it's mostly usable, but once I start adding lots of text and pictures it begins crashing frequently.

Because of this, I always stuck to a more simplified editing style to avoid crashes and performance issues. Unfortunately, I found this style to be a little boring and I wanted to do something to improve it.

I still want my videos to remain text-based (I don't like talking into a microphone), so the goal was to do something to make the on-screen text more interesting...

I made this adorable little text box with my own custom sprite sheet! It's so pretty, I'm really proud of it and I'll hopefully be using it in future too. This was my first time doing pixel art! I think the end result is super cute. She has 40+ expressions and the text is animated!

It immediately makes the videos more interesting to look at. Even if the content format is the exact same, the improved visual presentation makes a major difference.

But it doesn't just make the videos better to look at, it makes them much easier for me to edit too. In fact, all of the text and animation is done within RPGMaker! None of it is done within the actual editing software.

I write the script for the video within RPGMaker inside of a level map that only uses a flat green tileset. I then record the text scrolling and then chroma key out the background, just like a greenscreen. I wanted to use RPGMaker VX Ace for a more classic feel, but the image resolution is far too low with no way to increase it... ^ ^;

This helps massively with performance. Instead of Davinchi processing dozens of text objects, it's only processing the one clip I recorded in RPGM. Using this technique, I felt that my computer was running so much more smoothly during editing that it was usually.

The idea was really cute, and I'm so happy with how it turned out! I'm still not planning on making videos super often, but I'm definitely going to be using this style going forwards.

That's all for now, thanks for reading!
