I've added a couple new buttons to the site! You can now view both a gallery of my drawings, and a collection of some of my prior game development works. The layouts for these pages are currently a work in progress (the art gallery is especially unoptimised and takes long to load on slow connections) but I'll continue to work on it in the background.

The 'Home' button has been removed, seeing as this page isn't really all too important I didn't feel it was necessary to have an entire button for it. You can now click on the 'flatpancakesss.dev' at the top to return to this page instead.
